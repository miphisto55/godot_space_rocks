Game has controller support/mappings and I highly recommend using one if you have one:

Thrust Forward: <br>
Keyboard - W <br>
PS Controller - X <br>
Xbox Controller - A <br>

Turn Left: <br>
Keyboard - A <br>
PS Controller - C-pad LEFT <br>
Xbox Controller - C-pad LEFT <br>

Turn Right: <br>
Keyboard - D <br>
PS Controller - C-pad RIGHT <br>
Xbox Controller - C-pad RIGHT <br>

Strafe Left: <br>
Keyboard - Q <br>
PS Controller - L-Trigger <br>
Xbox Controller - L-Trigger <br>

Strafe Right: <br>
Keyboard - E <br>
PS Controller - R-Trigger <br>
Xbox Controller - R-Trigger <br>

Esc - Pause (half-broken, too lazy to care to fix it, but I know what the issue is)

Objective: Clear asteroids/enemies for points. When all asteroids cleared, another wave is started. Waves get progressively harder.

Tips: Try to stay center as Enemies and Asteroids spawn near the edges. Shield regens over time. Get powerups, Use thrust lightly as to control your spaceship better. Strafing is good for following targets on a parallel so you don't have to adjust your aim with turning as much (just as good as turning though when you get better).
